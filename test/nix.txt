To disable SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) on Fedora, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on your Fedora system.

2. Edit the SELinux configuration file using a text editor with root privileges. For example, you can use the nano editor:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/selinux/config
   ```

3. Locate the line that says `SELINUX=enforcing` and change it to:

   ```
   SELINUX=disabled
   ```

   This line sets SELinux to be disabled on system startup.

4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

5. Reboot your system to apply the changes:

   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

Upon reboot, SELinux will be disabled on your Fedora system. Keep in mind that disabling SELinux can impact system security. It is recommended to only disable SELinux if you have a specific reason and understand the potential risks.
